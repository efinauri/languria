__ABOUT__

languria is a toy programming language made for self-teaching and personal use, written by referencing the excellent [crafting intepreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book by R. Nystrom. 
The name ("the watermelon" in italian) is the first thing that came to mind that starts with lang-. Appearently it's also a [beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languria), which might as well make for a nice mascot!
